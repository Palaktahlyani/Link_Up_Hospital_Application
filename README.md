### To run a Flutter app locally, you can use the following commands in the terminal/command prompt:

- $ cd <flutter_application_1>

     --This command changes the current directory to the root directory of the Flutter project.
 
 - $ flutter run
 
     --This command starts the app in debug mode and launches it in the connected device or emulator.
